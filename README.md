# q1project
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) compiled a list for risk factors regarding Alzheimer’s disease and Healthy Aging Data. Alzheimer’s disease is a common brain disorder that slowly destroys memory capabilities and cognitive processes. From the questionnaire, we use this project to identify and classify the six categories used to differentiate risk factors for Alzheimer’s based on specific questions asked. These classification models can allow for improved annotation in medical notes in future surveys.

In this repository we have five folders: data, data_preprocess, deliverables, postattribute_selection, and traintest_sets.

1. data, traintest_sets, & data_preprocess: this holds all the data we used and the files we used to preprocess our data e.g. Alzh_no_na.csv and Alzh_val.csv
